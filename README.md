# AI Virtual Gesture-Controlled Keyboard

A real-time **hand-gesture-based virtual keyboard** built using **Python, OpenCV, and CVZone**. Users can type by performing a **thumb and index finger pinch gesture** to press keys. The keyboard includes CAPS, Space, Backspace, Clear, rounded UI buttons, and a symmetric layout.

## Features

* Hand gesture detection using **CVZone HandDetector**
* **Pinch to click** (thumb and index)
* Clean **dark UI** with rounded keys
* Perfectly **centered and symmetric layout**
* CAPS toggle
* Space, Backspace, Clear
* Smooth performance (optimized)
* Real-time typing output box

---

## Tech Stack

* **Python 3**
* **OpenCV**
* **CVZone**
* **Pynput**

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install opencv-python cvzone pynput
```

---

## Run the App

```bash
python main.py
```

## Controls

| Action         | Gesture                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Press Key      | Thumb and Index Finger Pinch |
| Type Lowercase | CAPS off                   |
| Type Uppercase | CAPS on                    |
| Backspace      | Press BACK                 |
| Clear All      | Press CLEAR                |
| Space          | Press SPACE                |
| Quit App       | Press Q                    |

## How It Works

* Detects hand landmarks using **CVZone HandDetector**.
* Tracks **Index Tip (8)** and **Thumb Tip (4)**.
* Measures distance.
* If distance is less than the threshold, a **key press event** occurs.
* The UI is drawn each frame using custom rounded rectangles.
